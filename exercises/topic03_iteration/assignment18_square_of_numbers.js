# Square of numbers (exam second session)
Write a program that takes a number as input.
The number must be between 2 and 9 (two limits included),
if not, the program prints `No Output`.
Otherwise, the program can get to work: it prints a square of numbers:

The first row are just the numbers 1 through the entered number.
The second row contains all the doubles, ...
the last row starts with the entered number and contains all the n-multiples.

Below is the largest possible output, i.e., for 9:

```
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18
  3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27
  4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36
  5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45
  6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54
  7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63
  8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72
  9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81
```

Make sure your output prints in a nice square,
you do this by preceding each number with spaces if necessary.
You can also do this in the first column if you like.

**Tip:** you know that 81 is the largest value you will
ever have to print and so all the numbers will consist of 1 or 2 digits.

**Side note:** By the end of the semester,
we expect you to use functions to solve this problem.
For now, make it without function and revisit the
exercise after the fall break.
