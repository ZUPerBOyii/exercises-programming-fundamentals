# The Swap Trick
Write a program that reads two inputs into the two variables `a` and `b`.
Make sure that the contents of `a` and `b` are swapped before printing.

We already provided the code for the input and the output.
You should only provide the code for 'the swap' (between the two lines of comments)
You can update this program, but are not allowed to change it!

**Hint:** You can introduce a third variable.

import io from "../../utils/io-for-pf.js";

let a = io.read(); // do not (re)move this line
let b = io.read(); // do not (re)move this line

// Write your program below:
let c = b;
b = a;
a = c;
// Write your program above.

io.write(a); // do not (re)move this line
io.write(b); // do not (re)move this line
