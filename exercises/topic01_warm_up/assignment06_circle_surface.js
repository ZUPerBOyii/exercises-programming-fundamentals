/*
# Area of a disk (circle)
Write a program that reads the radius of a circle (``float``),
and computes and prints the area up to 3 digits after the decimal point.
You can ignore negative radius's by treating them as regular radius's.

**Hint:** In JavaScript you can represent π by using `Math.PI`.

**Hint:** In JavaScript you can convert a (floating point) number
to a string using `toFixed`(inverse of parseFloat). Turning π into the string
`3.14` (two digits after the decimal point) would than look like this:
`Math.PI.toFixed(2)`.

import io from "../../utils/io-for-pf.js";
let radius = parseFloat(io.read());
let area = radius * radius * Math.PI;

io.write(area.toFixed(3));
