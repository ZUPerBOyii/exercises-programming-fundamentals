/*
# Highest frequency (I)
Write a program that asks for numerical input (integers)
between 0 and 99 (both bounds inclusive).
When the user inputs a number outside this interval
the program stops asking input.

Finally, print the number that was entered the most.
You can print -1 if there was no valid input.
If multiple numbers apply, print the smallest.

# Hint 1: you can make use of the size of the interval
# Hint 2: you can make an array a priory instead of on the fly

## Example
    > 3
    > 2
    > 1
    > 3
    > 5
    > 3
    > 1
    > -10
    3

    > 1
    > 3
    > 2
    > 1
    > 3
    > 5
    > 3
    > 1
    > 678
    1

    > 123
    -1
